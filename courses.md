# Nuclear Engineering Coursework

## NE470: Reactor Theory
Covers basic reactor stuff but mostly focuses on solutions to the neutron diffusion equation in 1-dimension. There are three projects, of increasing difficulty. If you take this class with Dr. Chvala you may be required to do all of the programming in FORTRAN, so be ready for that.

Need:
- Comfortable with calculus

Nice to have:
- OK with some computer programming (besides/in addition to MATLAB)

Notes:
- We all have the book for this one if you don't want to buy it

Difficulty:
4/5

## NE530: Nuclear Security Sci & Analysis

## NE532: Advanced Nuclear Security Sci & Analysis

## NE550: Radiation Measurements Laboratory
Covers a number of detectors with a long lab course. Do ***NOT*** be fooled by the 3 credit hours this class gets in the course catalog. You will have 3 hours of lecture, 3 hours of lab, and an average of 12-15 hours of work on the lab reports in this class. And they will be long, frustrating hours.

You will also do a lot of error propagation in this class. This is a necessary skill, and you will get a LOT of practice at it.

Need:
- Shake the rust off of the parts of your brain that know how to take derivatives

Nice to have:
- Some exposure to electronics labs
- Feel good about multivariable calculus

Notes:
- You might have to use Mathematica software for this class

Difficulty:
5/5, maybe 6/5

## NE551: Radiation Protection
Covers all the ways radiation deposits energy in matter, with some focus near the beginning and end on regulations and biological/chemical effects. You'll spend a good chunk of time doing momentum/energy conservation calculations, and probably will have to program the Bethe-Bloch equation to calculate stopping power.

Need: 
- Some programming
- Some physics (energy/momentum conservation)

Nice to have:
- N/A

Notes:
- N/A

Difficulty:
3/5 if taught well

# Other Departments

## CHEM580: Radiochemistry (dual listed in NE)
This class is taught by Dr. Schweizer, who was born in 1925 and worked on the Manhattan Project. The subject matter is pretty basic, but he grades very hard.

Need:
- N/a

Nice to have:
- Some Chemistry knowledge

Notes:
- N/a

Difficulty:
4/5
