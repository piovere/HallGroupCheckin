# HallGroupCheckin
Resources for (new) Students in the Hall Research Group. Everything in here is a loose sketch--your specific circumstances should always override these general cases. As always, ask if something in here doesn't seem to apply.

This guide is aimed at full-time students pursuing their PhD who do not already have a Master's degree. Active duty military here for the Master's program should look elsewhere. Eventually there will probably be a guide for you.

# Check-in
Do these things as soon as you join the group.

## Admissions stuff
- [ ] Send letter of acceptance to ?????
- [ ] Email John and Howard; Ask John to assign a sponsor
- [ ] Contact your sponsor for any questions over the summer about good places to live, etc.

## University stuff
- [ ] Get an email address
- [ ] Get a university ID card

## Safety training
*[Available on Canvas](https://utk.instructure.com)*  
*Print/Save as PDF each completion certificate*
- [ ] EH&S training on Compressed Gas Cylinder A

- [ ] Email [Shawn Drake](mailto:sdrake4@utk.edu) to be added to the online training for Open Source and Sealed Source (also on Canvas)
- [ ] Do the online training for radiation safety

- [ ] Email all certificates (7 online plus one from radiation safety class) to [Matt Cook](mailto:mcook4@vols.utk.edu).

# Good classes for new graduate students
The goal for your first year should be to get ready to take quals.

## If you have a degree in nuclear engineering
- Rachel
- And
- Duncan
- And
- Matt
- Fill
- This
- In

## If your degree is in some other field
- Fall Semester
    - NE470 (Reactor Theory): This will involve several projects with some calculus-2 based derivations and computer programming. Don't stress too much if you don't have a background in programming, there are resources in the group that can help. **Everyone should take this class in their first semester**
    - NE551 (Radiation Protection): This is the class following 
- Spring Semester
    - NE550 (Radiation Detection): This class is a kick in the teeth, but you'll pretty much need it. It covers the different categories of radiation detectors along with a lab that uses most of them. This class will take up **A LOT** of time.

# What you have to do to get your PhD
There are several steps to get your PhD. This is meant as a single-source site to aid in planning. Things could shift without me knowing; please check my math before you take anthing in here as gospel.

## Take some classes
The requirements for coursework are:
- 48 credits of classes
    - 30 credits must be 500-level or above in the NE department
    - No more than 12 credits may be 400-level
    - At least 6 credits above 600 level
        - At least 3 credits towards this requirement must be in the NE department
- 24 hours of doctoral research
    - NE600

## Pass the Quals
Quals are offered in late May. The department website suggests taking the quals after 30 hours of coursework; I don't know why they do this. You should plan to take them after your first year in grad school, unless you have some reason not to. 

Quals are taken over two days. The first day is two 90-minute tests, one on topics covered in Reactor Theory (NE470), the other on topics covered in Radiation Shielding (NE433 and NE551). The second day is a 3-hour test in your field of research. Most of our group takes the **Security** qualifier. Useful classes for this:
   - NE530: Overview of security topics,
   - NE542: Fuel Cycles (for topics related to diversion, etc), and
   - NE550: Yeah, the really hard class I talked about above.
